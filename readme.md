Requires at least: 3.5  
Tested up to: 5.7  

This plugin isn't very useful in modern WordPress, as most metaboxes are being replaced with the Block Editor experience.

Change the color for the metabox headers for easy visibility.

## Installation

1. Upload the contents of the zip file to the your plugins directory (default: `/wp-content/plugins/`)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the Metabox Header Color page under Settings
4. Enter the color hex code you'd like to use and save
